# Domineering is a game for 1 or 2 players. To now the rules i recomend to read sth about it in wikipedia.

  ## My inpretation: 
        - The Board have columns named like A, B, C, D ...  and lines named like  a, b, c, d ...  and YOU CHOOSE FROM WITH FIELD WILL BE STARTING YOUR MOVE 
        - Player1 is plaing verticaly, and in move gives first name of COLUMN and after this name of LINE    like  Cg   or   Aa 
        - Player2 is plaing horizontaly, and in move gives first name of LINE and after this name of COLUMN    like  gC   or   aA   
          so theres different way
        - In the begining of the game we'll ask you how many players will play becouse you can play with your mate or with computer 
        - Move of each players you write in terminal
        - When player wont to give his move to opponent, he has to write ' - ' in terminal
        - Write ' . ' (dot) when you want to give up 
        - FIELDS is value of how many field you can take with you single move
        - You can change values of FIELDS, HEIGHT, WIDTH or RANDOM_NUMBER if you want
        - RANDOM_NUMBER is the number the program use only to choose one move if computer have >1 the same good for him moves
        
   # GOOD LUCK GUYS!
